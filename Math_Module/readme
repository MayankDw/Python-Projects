Math Module created in Python 
This module can be imported as python library to perform required math operations
Module can be extended based on requirement. 
For simplicity and basic understanding of python module very basis functions are added

__init__.py is normally empty but here empty function is created because empty file was unable to commit in GitHub. 
That is not mandatory, you may leave file empty. 

def empty():
    pass
   
Available math function within this library are as follows: 

# # We are going to create Math Module 
#
#   Math Module 
#       __init__.py
#       Arithmetic
#           __init__.py
#           add_numbers.py
#           sub_numbers.py
#       Geometry
#           __init__.py
#           area_right_traingle.py
#           area_rectangle.py
#           area_circle.py
#           circum_circle.py

    

#   __init__.py 
#    
#    File is required to distinguish these directories from being a normal directores
#    This tells python that these are python modules that perform some operations

#  Next steps is to write code by .py files
#   add_numbers.py
#   sub_numbers.py
#   ...
#   ...
#   circum_circle.py

#  Write code in these directories and save in specific folders.
